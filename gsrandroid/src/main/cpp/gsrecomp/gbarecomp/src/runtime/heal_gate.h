// heal_gate.h — P6 differential-gate primitives (snapshot / restore / diff).
//
// Before an sljit-healed shard is trusted to run live, the gate runs it AND the
// interpreter from the SAME pre-call state and compares their effects. Because a
// v1 sljit shard bakes the real &g_cpu / &bus_write_* addresses, it mutates the
// live machine in place — so "same-state replay" is a save → run → restore →
// run → diff dance against the real state. These primitives provide the
// save/restore/diff half of that dance; the gate STATE MACHINE (consecutive-
// clean budget, device-touch pinning, interp-first orchestration) lives one
// layer up in gbarecomp_runtime, which has the overlay/heal hooks.
//
// Two interchangeable snapshot strategies (selectable so they cross-check each
// other — the obviously-correct one validates the fast one):
//   * FULL-RAM  — copy the five writable RAM regions verbatim. No bus hook,
//                 obviously correct, ~386 KB per capture. The reference.
//   * JOURNAL   — record only the writes a pass makes (at the GbaBus write
//                 chokepoint) and roll back by replaying the inverse. Cost is
//                 proportional to the function's actual write footprint. (Built
//                 in a later step; this header reserves its types.)
//
// This module is PURE: it depends only on ArmCpuState (the CPU file) and
// gba::GbaBus, never on the runtime globals (g_cpu / g_runtime_cycles). The gate
// passes those in. That keeps it unit-testable by linking just gbarecomp_gba.
