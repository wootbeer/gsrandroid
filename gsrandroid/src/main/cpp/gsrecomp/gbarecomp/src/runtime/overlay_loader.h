// overlay_loader.h — Stage-2 self-heal dispatch tier + background compiler.
//
// Stage 1 bridges a dispatch miss through the interpreter on EVERY hit. Stage 2
// closes the loop: the first miss for a PC enqueues a background compile (emit
// → g++ → cached DLL → LoadLibrary); once the native function lands, a third
// dispatch tier (overlay_resolve) routes that PC to native code on every
// subsequent hit, and the interpreter bridge stops running for it.
//
// Threading: g_healed (the PC → native-fn table) is written ONLY by the game
// thread (overlay_drain_ready moves finished work at frame or safe guest-call
// boundaries), so the hot-path read in overlay_resolve is lock-free. Only
// the work/ready queues cross to the worker thread (mutex-protected).
//
// The whole feature is gated behind GBARECOMP_SELFHEAL_RECOMPILE: when unset,
// overlay_loader_init no-ops, overlay_resolve always returns nullptr, and the
// runtime is a pure Stage-1 bridge (used as the A/B baseline for the GFP1 gate).
//
// Doctrine (PRINCIPLES.md): healed-from-cache is STILL NOT fully static — the
// build is done only when the merged TOML makes the static corpus cover it.
// See self_heal.h.
// GBARECOMP_STRICT_STATIC=1 is the acceptance gate: it disables cache loading,
// background compilation, and interpreter bridging; any dispatch miss aborts.
