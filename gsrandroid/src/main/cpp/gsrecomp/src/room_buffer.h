// room_buffer.h — milestone 2, step 1: build a room's tilemap ahead of time
// and prove it is right.
//
// Nothing here changes what appears on screen. It builds, from the EWRAM map
// tables, the tile entries the game is about to put in VRAM, then compares
// them against what the game actually put there. A mismatch count of zero
// over a session is the evidence that a room can be reconstructed offline —
// which is the whole premise of milestone 2 (see ROADMAP.md).
//
// Doing it this way round was a deliberate choice: verifying against live
// VRAM is exact, needs no renderer change, and cannot be fooled the way a
// "looks right on screen" check can. The old widescreen work failed three
// times partly because its per-pixel answers were never checked against
// anything.
//
// Every address and rule below is measured, with the evidence in FACTS.md.
// None of it is inferred from how the code "ought" to work:
//
//   room rect   0x02030DC0  four u16: min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, in pixels
//               ("The bounds field offsets are recovered")
//   camera      0x02030DB0  x and y, 16.16 fixed point, same pixel space
//   id grid     0x02010000  128x128 u32, low 12 bits are the metatile id
//   atlas       0x02020000  8 bytes per id: four u16 text-mode tile entries,
//                           top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right
//   per layer   the layer's own grid region is offset from the ground layer
//               by (BGxHOFS - camera_x)/16, (BGxVOFS - camera_y)/16, taking
//               the scroll registers UNMASKED — the game writes values wider
//               than the hardware's 9 bits and the excess is the offset
//               ("Per-layer sourcing, settled 2026-09-05")
