// The shader below is the GBA's own background rule, expressed once and run on
// the card instead of per pixel on the processor:
//
//   screen pixel -> add the layer's scroll -> find the map entry for that tile
//   -> read the tile number, flips and palette bank -> find that pixel inside
//   the tile -> read its colour index -> look the colour up -> emit it
//
// Colour index 0 is the console's transparency and is discarded, which is what
// lets the layers stack.
//
// Alpha blending and semi-transparent objects need to know what lies directly
// BENEATH the winning pixel, and whether that is itself a blend target --
// painter's order throws that information away as soon as the next quad
// overwrites it. So every quad is drawn twice into two scratch textures with
// the GPU's own depth test doing the sorting (smaller sort_key wins, exactly
// the reference's rule): once recording the frontmost candidate ("top") and
// once recording the runner-up ("second", by discarding anything that is not
// better than what "top" already recorded at that pixel). A final full-screen
// pass then applies the console's compose rule -- alpha blend, brightness, or
// the top colour unchanged -- reading only those two records
// (`gba_ppu.cpp`, `render_scanline_internal`, the code right after the object
// loop). Each record is the RAW, unfaded, unblended 15-bit colour plus the
// sort key and a semi-transparent flag, packed into an RGBA8 texture so the
// two write passes stay simple colour output and the resolve pass does all of
// the arithmetic in one place, matching the reference exactly.

// The window pass: one full-screen quad computing GBATEK's window_control(x)

// > outside, exactly gba_ppu.cpp:668-720; with no window enabled every layer
// and blending are on (0x3F). Window rectangles are the console's own
// 240x160 space, so this reads the pixel through the same camera offset as
// the background and object passes.
//
// The window registers (and DISPCNT's own window-enable bits) are read per
// row from `u_row_io`, not a frame-level uniform: this is what lets a frame
// that rewrites WIN0H every scanline -- the room-transition iris, carving
// its shrinking circle -- draw correctly. A pixel outside the console's own
// 0..159 rows (a widened output's top/bottom margin) has no real scanline of
// its own; it reads the nearest real row's registers, the same extension
// the background shader's `reg_row` clamp uses. Because this pass covers the
// WHOLE output including the left/right and top/bottom margins, and the
// peel/resolve passes discard or blank a layer wherever this control byte
// says to, the transition's own WINOUT rule -- which during an iris turns
// every layer off outside the circle -- reaches every margin pixel exactly
// as it reaches the console's own 240x160, independent of whether the room
// buffer could otherwise have supplied that pixel.
